    "## Course Assessment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This course assessment (CA) represents 60% of the overall module assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an individual exercise and your attention is drawn to the College and University guidelines on collaboration and plagiarism, which are available from the [College website](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/students/administration/complaintsandappeals/academicmisconduct/). \n",
    "Students are **not allowed** to use Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc) to generate code for the CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission information:**\n",
    "1. do not change the name of this notebook, i.e. the notebook file has to be: `ca2.ipynb`\n",
    "2. do not add you name or student code in the notebook or in the file name\n",
    "3. do not remove or delete or add any cell in this notebook\n",
    "4. make sure to **remove** and **delete** the `raise NotImplementedError()` under the `# YOUR CODE HERE` and replace it with **your code**: note that if you leave it in the cell you will fail the associated test\n",
    "5. do not remove the function `save_history()` at the end of each cell. This function will save your edit operations on the code in the cell and will be used as proof of work, i.e. proof that you have been working on the questions assigned\n",
    "6. work always in the cells provided when developing your implementation, i.e. do not work on another notebook or with programming environments that do not operate on this notebook.\n",
    "7. when you are finished debugging **remove** all code that is not part of the function definition, i.e. leave only the clean function implementation in the cell: do not leave debugging `print` statements in the functions, and do not leave function invocations on test inputs\n",
    "8. make sure that the execution of the cell **does not produce any type of output**: the execution of the cell should only define the desired functions\n",
    "9. before the final submission run the function `check_and_prepare_for_submission()` in the last cell of the notebook: this function will create a zip archive called `ecmm422ca2.zip` which contains your notebook and the folder `proof_of_work`.\n",
    "10. Submit only the file `ecmm422ca2.zip`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation criteria:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each question asks for one or more functions to be implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each function is awarded a number of marks. \n",
    "- One or more hidden unit tests are going to evaluate if all desired properties of the required function are met. \n",
    "- If the function passes a test all the associated marks are awarded, if it fails 0 marks are awarded.\n",
    "- If you make a typo error (e.g. misspelling a variable) this will likely causes a syntax error, the function execution will fail and you will be awarded 0 marks.\n",
    "- Do not make assumptions on the state of previous cells, i.e. expect each function to be evaluated independently, moreover expect each function to be tested in the unit tests on some *randomly* generated input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the test use a hard fail/pass strategy to assign marks, the presence of several questions and several unit tests per question allows a fine grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Checkpoints are not graded by default, but might be used to assign additional marks in case the execution of the code obtains the desired results even when some tests might fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficiency:** There is a cap of a few minutes on the execution of each cell and unit test. Make sure your code is not terribly inefficient (for example having a cell run for hours, e.g. using nested loops rather than NumPy functions that can work directly on  arrays), otherwise the execution of the cell/unit test will be interrupted and considered a failure.

    "**Objective:**\n",
    "The objective of this section of the programming assignment is to implement various functions related to sequence generation, permutation, and perturbation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions to Implement:**\n",
    "1. `permute(seq)`\n",
    "   - **Input:** `seq` - a sequence of characters\n",
    "   - **Output:** A randomly permuted version of the input sequence `seq`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `generate_master_sequence(alphabet_size, seq_length, start_char=70)`\n",
    "   - **Input:**\n",
    "     - `alphabet_size`: Number of unique characters in the generated sequence\n",
    "     - `seq_length`: Length of the generated sequence\n",
    "     - `start_char`: ASCII value of the starting character in the sequence (default value is 70)\n",
    "   - **Output:** A randomly generated master sequence of the specified length and alphabet size\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `perturb(master_sequence, noise)`\n",
    "   - **Input:**\n",
    "     - `master_sequence`: The original sequence to be perturbed\n",
    "     - `noise`: A float value indicating the degree of perturbation to apply to the sequence\n",
    "   - **Output:** A perturbed version of the master sequence based on the specified noise level. To perturb a sequence you should repeatedly swap the position of two elements of the sequence at random. The parameter `noise` is a float that indicates the fraction of times that the swapping should take place. The actual number of times can be computed as `noise` * the number of elements of the input sequence. So if `noise=0.1` and the sequence has 200 elements, then the number of times that the swapping should take place is 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `randomize_length(seqs, endpoint_trim_dim)`\n",
    "   - **Input:**\n",
    "     - `seqs`: A list of sequences\n",
    "     - `endpoint_trim_dim`: Maximum number of characters to trim from both ends of each sequence. A random number between 0 and `endpoint_trim_dim` is selected for\n",

    "   - **Output:** List of sequences containing inliers and outliers generated based on the master sequence and noise parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `make_data(master_sequence, n_clusters, cluster_centres_noise, n_inliners, n_outliers, inliner_noise, outlier_noise, endpoint_trim_dim=None)`\n",
    "   - **Input:**\n",
    "     - `master_sequence`: The original sequence representing the cluster center\n",
    "     - `n_clusters`: Number of clusters to generate\n",
    "     - `cluster_centres_noise`: Degree of noise to apply to cluster center sequences\n",

    "     - `targets`: List of cluster labels corresponding to each sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- The idea is to generate a master sequence of a certain lenght. This sequence has a random number of occurrences of `alphabet_size` distinct characters. This sequence will be used to generate all other sequences via perturbation.\n",
    "- In `make_single_cluster_data`, the idea is to generate a number `n_inliners + n_outliers` of sequence derived from the `master_sequence` in input. The inlier will be only slighlty perturbed, while the outliers will be greatly perturbed (this is controlled by the respective noise parameters). Note that there is no other difference between the inliners and the outliers apart from the amount of perturbation applied. \n",
    "- In `make_data` the idea is to start from the `master_sequence` in input and then generate a number `n_clusters` of derived master sequences. These will be used to seed each cluster. These sequences are not totally dissimilar, instead they will be generated as perturbations of the original master sequence by applying an amount of noise equal to `cluster_centres_noise`. So if a small amount of noise is applied, the centers of the clusters will be very similar.\n"

    "**Histogram Vectorizer and PCA Plotter**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "The objective of this section of the programming assignment is to implement various functions related to data preprocessing and visualization. Specifically, the candidate needs to implement a histogram vectorizer to convert sequences into numerical representations and a PCA plotter to visualize high-dimensional data in two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions to Implement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `histogram_vectorizer(seqs)`\n",
    "   - **Input:** \n",
    "     - `seqs`: A list of sequences (strings)\n",
    "   - **Output:** \n",
    "     - A matrix where each row represents the histogram vectorized representation of a sequence in the input list.\n",
    "   - **Description:** \n",
    "     - This function takes a list of sequences as input and converts each sequence into a histogram vectorized representation. It utilizes inner functions to facilitate the conversion process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `pca_plot(X, y=None)`\n",
    "   - **Input:** \n",
    "     - `X`: Data matrix where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature.\n",
    "     - `y` (optional): Labels corresponding to each sample for color-coding in the plot.\n",
    "   - **Output:** \n",
    "     - A scatter plot visualizing the input data points after performing PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality to 2D.\n",
    "   - **Description:** \n",
    "     - This function takes a data matrix `X` and performs PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 2D. It then generates a scatter plot to visualize the data points. If labels `y` are provided, data points will be color-coded based on the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- Implement the inner functions (`convert_to_int_sequence` and `single_histogram_vectorizer`) within the `histogram_vectorizer` function.\n",
    "- Ensure that the implemented functions conform to the specified signatures and requirements.\n",
    "- Use appropriate libraries and data structures to efficiently implement the functions.\n",
    "- Validate the correctness and functionality of each function thoroughly.\n",
    "- Include comments and docstrings to explain the purpose and functionality of each function.\n",
    "- Consider edge cases and handle exceptions gracefully.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is to implement a function for visualizing sequences in a 2-dimensional space using Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS). The function should allow for visualization of sequences along with optional additional features such as true labels, predicted labels, and support vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function to Implement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `plot_seq_2d(seqs, y=None, preds=None, is_support=None, kernel_func=None, param=None)`\n",
    "   - **Input:**\n",
    "     - `seqs`: List of sequences to be plotted.\n",
    "     - `y`: True labels corresponding to the sequences (optional).\n",
    "     - `preds`: Predicted labels corresponding to the sequences (optional).\n",
    "     - `is_support`: Boolean array indicating whether a sequence is a support vector (optional).\n",
    "     - `kernel_func`: Kernel function used for computing the Gram matrix (optional).\n",
    "     - `param`: Parameter(s) required by the kernel function (optional).\n",
    "   - **Output:**\n",
    "     - None\n",
    "   - **Description:**\n",
    "     - Visualizes the sequences in a 2-dimensional space using Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS).\n",
    "     - Optionally, displays true labels (`y`), predicted labels (`preds`), and support vectors (`is_support`).\n",
    "     - Points representing sequences are colored based on the true labels (`y`).\n",
    "     - If `preds` and `y` are provided, misclassified instances are highlighted with 'X' markers.\n",
    "     - If `is_support` is provided, support vectors are indicated with smaller points with a black border.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes:**\n",
    "- The function should utilize the provided `get_gram_matrix` and `gram_matrix_to_distance_matrix` functions to compute the Gram matrix and distance matrix, respectively.\n",
    "- Ensure the visualization is clear and informative, with appropriate labeling and coloring of data points.\n",
    "- See the Checkpoint for an example of what the output should look like.\n"
